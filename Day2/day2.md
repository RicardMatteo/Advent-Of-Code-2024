# Day 2

Today, I focused on keeping the solution concise.

## Part 1
Creating the `is_safe` function was definitely worth it. It not only simplified Part 1 but it also allows me to finish the part 2 in 3 minutes.

## Part 2
For this part, I needed to check if removing one level from the report would result in a valid configuration. The solution works, but there’s room for optimization since we don’t need to recheck the combinations from the start each time.
